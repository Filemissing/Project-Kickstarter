  description: "These freshwater species are found in disjunct tropical regions of
    South America (Colomesus asellus and Colomesus tocantinensis), Africa (six Tetraodon
    species), and Southeast Asia (Auriglobus, Carinotetraodon, Dichotomyctere, Leiodon
    and Pao). Some species are endangered : Takifugu chinensis, Redline pufferfish
    Small to medium less than 50 cm The majority of pufferfish species are toxic,
    with some among the most poisonous vertebrates in the world. some species is
    considered a delicacy in Japan (as \u6CB3\u8C5A, fugu), Korea (as \uBCF5, bok,
    or \uBCF5\uC5B4, bogeo), and China (as \u6CB3\u8C5A, h\xE9t\xFAn) when prepared
    by specially trained chefs who know which part is safe to eat and in what quantity
    The species Torquigener albomaculosus was described by David Attenborough as
    \"the greatest artist of the animal kingdom\" due to the males' unique habit
    of wooing females by creating nests in sand composed of complex geometric designs.
    The puffer's excellent eyesight, combined with this speed burst, is the first
    and most important defense against predators. The pufferfish's secondary defense
    mechanism, used if successfully pursued, is to fill its extremely elastic stomach
    with water (or air when outside the water) until it is much larger and almost
    spherical in shape. Even if they are not visible when the puffer is not inflated,
    all puffers have pointed spines Traditionally, their diet consists mostly of
    algae and small invertebrates. Larger species of pufferfish are able to use their
    beak-like front teeth to break open clams, mussels, and other shellfish "
