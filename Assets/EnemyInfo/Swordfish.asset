  description: 'The swordfish (Xiphias gladius), also known as the broadbill[5] in
    some countries, are large, highly migratory predatory fish characterized by a
    long, flat, pointed bill. They are the sole member of the family Xiphiidae.[6][7]
    They are a popular sport fish of the billfish category. Swordfish are elongated,
    round-bodied, and lose all teeth and scales by adulthood. These fish are found
    widely in tropical and temperate parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans,
    and can typically be found from near the surface to a depth of 550 m (1,800 ft),
    and exceptionally up to depths of 2,234 m.[3] They commonly reach 3 m (10 ft)
    in length, and the maximum reported is 4.55 m (14 ft 11 in) in length and 650
    kg (1,430 lb) in weight.[4][8]'
