  description: 'The catfish can be found in all sorts of waters! Their ancestry comes
    from South America.   They are not endangered, except for some rare types! Endangered
    species of catfish - velvet catfish, mountain catfish, Mekong giant catfish 
    The catfish have gained their name for the prominent whiskers by their mouths!
    They have no scales, only smooth skin. Catfish are nocturnal. Catfish can make
    sounds with their mouths, similar to drumming - they use these to chat with the
    other fish! Due to their negative buoyancy, they sink rather than float and are
    bottom feeders. Rather than chomping, they suck down their prey.   Eats anything
    - both fauna and flora (though its food menu mainly consists of small crustaceans)!   '
