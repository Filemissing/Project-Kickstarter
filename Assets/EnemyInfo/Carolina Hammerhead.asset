  description: 'The Carolina hammerhead (Sphyrna gilberti) is a species of hammerhead
    shark, and part of the family Sphyrnidae, found in the western Atlantic Ocean.
    Their pupping grounds are in nearshore waters off the southeastern U.S. with
    the highest concentrations found in Bulls Bay, South Carolina.[3] The Carolina
    hammerhead has also been found in nearshore waters off of Brazil.[4] It was formally
    described in 2013.[5] It is currently classified as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN
    Red List due to overfishing and habitat degradation.  Little is known about the
    habits of the species. It is a sister species to S. lewini. As of 2013 This species
    has been a relatively new addition to the hammerhead shark genus. The species
    possesses a major genetic difference from their cousins, most notable differences
    is the lower vertebral number and a lighter outer tone.[6] The Carolina hammerhead
    is named in honor of Carter Gilbert, who unknowingly recorded the first known
    specimen of the shark off Charleston, South Carolina, in 1967.[7] Dr. Gilbert,
    who was the curator of the Florida Museum of Natural History from 1961 to 1998,
    caught what he believed was an anomalous scalloped hammerhead shark with 10 fewer
    vertebrae than a typical scalloped hammerhead. It was not confirmed to be a different
    species altogether until Quattro''s discovery in 2013. The general diet of the
    Carolina hammerheads consists of bony fishes and cephalopods such as squids,
    octopuses, and cuttlefishes. They also feed on shrimps, lobsters, crabs, and
    other smaller sharks and rays. '
